I'm an avid gamer (both tabletop and video games) and programmer, with my favorite game in particular being Super Metroid from the SNES. I recently graduated from the University of Mary Washington with a major in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. Outside of programming, I enjoy sound design, worldbuilding, and playing music as a whole (drums, bass, and guitar).

I'm most comfortable working in Python, though I have experience with Javascript and HTML/CSS.
